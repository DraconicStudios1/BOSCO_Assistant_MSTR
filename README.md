BOSCO Assistant ALPHA

Currently BOSCO doesn't stand for anything, and only contains basic functions to tell your local time, date and the time until a set of specified hours/minutes

IF you change the time until timeset, you MUST use 24 hour timestamps. Nothing else works with the math.

You CANNOT use datetime.datetime.strftime string sets for the math. Trust me, I tried.

BOSCO is built using the Tkinter Python application backbone, and as such, looks like a Windows 95 application. If anyone knows how to fix that and actually use images for stuff, please contact me at: bluecolt08@gmail.com, Discord: dracstudios.

Currently BOSCO has been developed and tested STRICTLY on Windows 11 devices, I have no clue if it works on any forms of Linux, earlier Windows versions, or MacOS. You are welcome to branch this repo and try to convert it if you so please.

BE CAREFUL, AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT USE MY CODE TO LEARN PYTHON. I JUST STARTED THIS SHIT.
